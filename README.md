# DD1-project1
1. Project Title:
  Logic Circuits Simulator

2. Project Description:
   The peoject is an event driven simulator that models the behavior of digital circuts acquired from a verlog .v file, that descirbe the circut based on input events acquired from a stimuli .stim file. After the sumiltion ends the program records the outputs in a simultion file .sim.

3. Key Features in the program:
   Verlog Support: Accepts verlog file as the circut input.
   Custom stimuli: Accepts a stimuli file (.stim) to specify events with precise timing.
   Support for multiple logic gates: and, or, xor, nand, nor, xnor, buf, not.
   Event-based simulation: Simulates changes in the circuit's state based on input stimuli file.
   Simulation output: Outputs events with timestamps in a simulation file (.sim).
   
4. Requirements:
   Programming Language: C++
   Dependencies:
     Any necessary libraries or tools
     Verilog Simulation Tool.

5. Usage:
   Once the project is ready, the user will be able to provide a verilog file (.v) with the circuit's description and a stimuli file (.stm) that provides input events. The simulator
   will process these files and generate an output file (output.sim) with the simulation results.
